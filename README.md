Technical Skills Assessment (PHP)
=================================

Requirements

* Local development environment with PHP (5.4+) interpreter and MySQL (5.5+) server

Instructions

1. Create a Github account if you don’t have one already
2. Send an email to michael@travel-group.com with the subject of “PHP Skills Assessment” and include your Github 
   account ID in the body. You will have 2 hours to complete the assessment from the time you send this email.
3. Fork the repository at: https://github.com/travelgroup/PHP-assessment into your account
4. Pull your forked repository into your IDE
5. Fix any PHP syntax errors you find. Errors have been intentionally placed in the code.
6. Modify code to meet PSR-1 and PSR-2 code style guidelines. Do NOT incorporate PSR-0 or PSR-4, as required by PSR-1. 
   Make use of self-documenting code principles where necessary. Identify and use other existing style conventions.
7. Initialize and run Composer to get needed dependencies
8. Create a MySQL database and import the ‘schema.sql’ file
9. Update ‘config/database.php’ with credentials to access newly created database
10. Run unit tests to see remaining failures
11. Make needed changes so all unit tests pass, however do NOT change the unit tests in any way.
12. Push ALL changes back to your forked repository, including database changes (into schema.sql)
13. Replace that ‘README.md’ file with the output of all the unit tests passing
14. Create a Pull Request to integrate the fixed code back into the master repository. The Pull Request will ultimately 
    not be merged but will signal your completion of the skills assessment.

Please ask for clarification if you have a question. Guessing an answer to an ambiguous directive will count against you.
